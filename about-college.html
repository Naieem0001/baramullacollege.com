<!-- ESTABLISHMENT & HISTORY -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Establishment and Historical Evolution</h2>

<p>
The roots of Government Degree College Baramulla go back to the late 19<sup>th</sup> century when
systematic educational efforts were initiated in the region through missionary and social initiatives.
The earliest organised learning centre was established in Baramulla to cater to the educational needs
of local children, particularly the underprivileged.
</p>

<p>
A primary school building was completed in the early twentieth century and formally inaugurated
in 1909. The institution gradually evolved into a high school in 1913.
</p>

<p>
In 1938, the institution was upgraded to an Intermediate College and eventually attained the status of a
Degree College in the year <strong>1943</strong>.
</p>

<p>
During the disturbances of 1947, academic activities were temporarily suspended. The college was
subsequently reopened on <strong>28 June 1954</strong>, marking a renewed commitment to higher education in
the region.
</p>

<p>
The present campus at <strong>Khwajabagh</strong> was formally inaugurated on <strong>20 November 1964</strong>.
Since then, the institution has grown into a major academic landmark of North Kashmir.
